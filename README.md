# Hi there, I'm Lea! 👋👾
### *Full Stack Web Developer trained by Le Wagon and SheCodes.io* 👩‍💻 🎉

🔭 I am currently working on the new Deviance app in my internship at RGMT Network UG...

👯 ... and if I am free, always open for collaborations!

🔥 My strength is definitely front end - especially CSS animations and LottieFiles animation. Also I am very good in Flutter.

⏳ My life before coding: After graduating from a high school with focus on psychology and sociology, I founded a business and later studied fashion design.

#### *🔍 Currently, I am searching eagerly for a remote job or internship as a Junior Web or App Developer.*

Therefore, if you know someone who is willed to give a highly motivated junior (be it front end or full stack) a chance, please make them contact me. 🤙😎
