# Hi there, I'm Lea! 👋👾
### *Full Stack Web Developer trained by Le Wagon and SheCodes.io* 👩‍💻 🎉

🔭 I am currently working as a front end developer at eClever...

👯 ... and if I am free, always open for collaborations!

🔥 My strength is definitely front end - especially CSS animations and LottieFiles animation. Also I am **very good in Flutter**.

⏳ My life before coding: After graduating from a high school with focus on psychology and sociology, I founded a business and studied fashion design later.
