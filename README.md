# Hi there, I'm Lea! üëãüëæ
### *Flutter Developer Looking For A Flutter Job* üë©‚Äçüíª üéâ

üî≠ I am currently working as a front end developer at eClever...

üëØ ... and if I am free, always open for collaborations!

üî• My strength is definitely front end - especially CSS animations and LottieFiles animation. Also I am **very good in Flutter**.

‚è≥ My life before coding: After graduating from a high school with focus on psychology and sociology, I founded a business and studied fashion design later.

### üì´ You can reach me via here GitHub, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lea-schumacher/) or via e-mail from my [portfolio website](https://crafted-codes.netlify.app/).
